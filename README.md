A public repository with some code I've written and it's worth sharing. Mainly academic projects.

- **armv7** - A ARMv7-based processor simulator with a 5-stage pipeline and 32 bits instructions. New instructions can be customized by using only configuration files (for specifying data operations and Current Program Status Register (CPSR) conditons). Written in object-oriented PHP. Data return through JSON, treated using mootools.
