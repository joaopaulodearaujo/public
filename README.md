# public

A public repository with some code I've written and it's worth sharing.

- **armv7** - A ARMv7-based processor simulator with a 5-stage pipeline and 32 bits instructions. New instructions can be customized by using only configuration files (for specifying data operations and Current Program Status Register (CPSR) conditons). Written in object-oriented PHP. Data return through JSON, treated using mootools.

- **phailom** - An object-oriented PHP meta-framework based on the Zend framework. It is entirely configurable via .ini files and was conceived for generating clean URLs for restful applications.

- **smuggler** - A small C project for simulating reliable transport (fixed-window size) through UDP connections. It simulates link and physical layers. Send/receive operations are coordinated by different threads.
